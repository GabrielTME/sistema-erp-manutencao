# Merged Single Spring Boot App (fixed)

This project was auto-generated by merging two backend projects into a single Spring Boot application.

## How to build & run
Requirements: Java 17+, Maven.

Build:
```
mvn clean package
```

Run:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will start on the port defined in `src/main/resources/application.properties` (default 8080).

## Notes / Things to check manually
- Review duplicate controller/request mappings to avoid path collisions.
- Check entity/table name collisions and JPA annotations.
- If errors about `javax.persistence` vs `jakarta.persistence` appear, note:
  - Spring Boot 3 uses Jakarta (`jakarta.persistence.*`). If your code uses `javax.persistence.*`, you'll need to update imports.
- If any beans fail on startup, review stacktrace and adjust conflicting beans / duplicate component names.
